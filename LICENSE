                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

This license, the Affero General Public License, applies to any program or
other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero GPL. Such a notice
grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use,
study, share and modify the work under the conditions stated herein. The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
